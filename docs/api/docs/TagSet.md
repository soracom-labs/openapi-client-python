# TagSet

An object which always contains at least one property \"name\" with a string value. If you give a subscriber/SIM a name, the name will be returned as the value of the \"name\" property. If the subscriber/SIM does not have a name, an empty string \"\" is returned. In addition, if you create any custom tags for the subscriber/SIM, each custom tag will appear as additional properties in the object.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**any string name** | **str** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
